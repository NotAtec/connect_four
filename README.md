## Built With
- Ruby
- Pry Byebug for debugging
- RSpec for testing

## Rspec Usage
This project was mostly intended to get used to TDD with RSpec, as such for each function I initially wrote the tests, and then continued with the code.

The tests that were written can be found in the `spec/connect_four_spec.rb` file.
